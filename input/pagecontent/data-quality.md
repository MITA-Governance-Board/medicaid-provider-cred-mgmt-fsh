# Data Quality Framework

## Overview

This framework establishes standards and procedures for ensuring high-quality data in Medicaid provider credentialing and enrollment systems. Data quality is critical for accurate provider information, effective program integrity, and successful interoperability.

## Data Quality Dimensions

### 1. Accuracy
- Data correctly represents real-world entities
- Information is free from errors and mistakes
- Values are precise and correct
- Regular validation against authoritative sources

### 2. Completeness
- All required data elements are present
- No missing critical information
- Comprehensive coverage of data requirements
- Minimal null or empty values

### 3. Consistency
- Data is uniform across systems and time
- No contradictory information
- Standardized formats and representations
- Coherent data relationships

### 4. Timeliness
- Data is current and up-to-date
- Information reflects recent changes
- Timely updates and refreshes
- Appropriate data retention periods

### 5. Validity
- Data conforms to defined formats and rules
- Values fall within acceptable ranges
- Proper data types and structures
- Compliance with business rules

### 6. Uniqueness
- No duplicate records or entries
- Unique identification of entities
- Proper deduplication processes
- Master data management

## Data Quality Standards

### Provider Data Standards

#### Practitioner Information
- **Name**: Complete legal name with proper formatting
- **Identifiers**: Valid NPI, state license numbers, DEA numbers
- **Demographics**: Current address, phone, email
- **Qualifications**: Valid licenses, certifications, education
- **Specialties**: Accurate specialty codes and descriptions

#### Organization Information
- **Legal Name**: Official registered business name
- **Identifiers**: Valid NPI, TIN, state registration numbers
- **Address**: Physical and mailing addresses
- **Contact Information**: Primary and secondary contacts
- **Ownership**: Accurate ownership and control information

#### Location Information
- **Address**: Standardized address format
- **Coordinates**: Accurate latitude/longitude
- **Service Areas**: Defined geographic coverage
- **Hours**: Current operating hours
- **Accessibility**: ADA compliance information

### Data Validation Rules

#### Format Validation
```fsh
// Example: NPI validation
Invariant: npi-format
Description: "NPI must be 10 digits"
Expression: "value.matches('[0-9]{10}')"
Severity: #error
```

#### Business Rule Validation
```fsh
// Example: License expiration
Invariant: license-not-expired
Description: "License must not be expired"
Expression: "period.end >= today()"
Severity: #error
```

#### Cross-Reference Validation
- Verify provider licenses with state boards
- Check exclusion lists (OIG, SAM, etc.)
- Validate addresses with postal services
- Confirm phone numbers and email addresses

## Data Quality Processes
