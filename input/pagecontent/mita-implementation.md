<i><b>NOTE: This information is based on MITA 3.0, which can be leveraged and updated for MITA 4.0</b></i>

This section provides guidance for implementing Medicaid provider credentialing and enrollment systems in alignment with MITA 3.0 principles and this FHIR Implementation Guide.

### MITA 3.0 Implementation Principles

1. **Modular Architecture**
- Implement loosely coupled services that can be independently deployed and scaled
- Use microservices architecture patterns where appropriate
- Ensure each module has well-defined interfaces and responsibilities

2. **API-First Design**
- Design RESTful APIs before implementing user interfaces
- Follow FHIR R4 specifications for healthcare data exchange
- Implement comprehensive API documentation and testing

3. **Cloud-Native Approach**
- Design for cloud deployment from the beginning
- Use containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Implement auto-scaling and load balancing capabilities

4. **Data Standards Compliance**
- Adopt FHIR R4 as the primary data exchange standard
- Implement US Core profiles where applicable
- Use standardized code systems and value sets
