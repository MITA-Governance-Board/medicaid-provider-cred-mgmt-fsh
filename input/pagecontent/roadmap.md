This page outlines the roadmap for future versions of the Medicaid Provider Credentialing and Enrollment FHIR Implementation Guide. The roadmap is based on implementer feedback, industry trends, and regulatory requirements.

### Roadmap Development Process

The roadmap is developed through a collaborative process involving:

1. **Implementer Feedback**: Collected through the feedback process, implementation community, and surveys. This includes structured feedback from early adopters, issue reports from implementation projects, feature requests from the community, and results from implementer surveys. The feedback is categorized, prioritized, and incorporated into the roadmap planning process to ensure that the IG evolves to meet real-world implementation needs.

2. **Work Group Input**: Guidance from the HL7 Financial Management Work Group, which provides expert oversight and direction for the IG. The Work Group reviews proposed changes, evaluates alignment with other HL7 standards, ensures consistency with FHIR principles, and provides domain expertise in financial and administrative healthcare processes. Regular Work Group meetings include dedicated sessions for roadmap planning and review.

3. **Regulatory Analysis**: Analysis of evolving CMS regulations and requirements related to provider enrollment, credentialing, and directory management. This includes monitoring of the Federal Register, CMS guidance documents, State Medicaid Director Letters, and other regulatory publications. The analysis identifies new requirements, compliance deadlines, and policy changes that need to be incorporated into the IG.

4. **Industry Trends**: Consideration of emerging industry trends and technologies in provider data management, credentialing, and enrollment. This includes monitoring of industry publications, vendor product roadmaps, healthcare IT standards development, and market research reports. The analysis identifies emerging patterns, innovative approaches, and technology shifts that should influence the IG's evolution.

5. **Connectathon Results**: Insights from FHIR Connectathon testing sessions dedicated to provider credentialing and enrollment scenarios. These events provide hands-on validation of IG components, identify interoperability challenges, test boundary conditions, and gather feedback from implementers in a structured testing environment. Results are documented, analyzed, and incorporated into the roadmap.

The roadmap is reviewed and updated quarterly by the IG maintenance team and approved by the HL7 Financial Management Work Group.

### Participation in Roadmap Development

Implementers and other stakeholders are encouraged to participate in roadmap development through:

1. **Feedback Submission**: Submit feedback through the feedback process using the structured feedback form available on the IG website. This feedback can include issue reports, feature requests, clarification questions, or suggestions for improvement. All feedback is tracked in a public issue repository, categorized by type and priority, and addressed by the IG maintenance team. Submitters receive notifications about the status of their feedback and can participate in the resolution process.

2. **Implementation Community**: Participate in the implementation community by joining the Provider Credentialing and Enrollment FHIR Implementation Community. This community includes implementers, vendors, payers, providers, and regulators involved in provider credentialing and enrollment. Community members share implementation experiences, discuss challenges, collaborate on solutions, and contribute to the evolution of the IG. The community maintains an active online presence with discussion forums, shared resources, and implementation tools.

3. **Annual Survey**: Respond to the annual implementer survey distributed each year to gather structured feedback on implementation experiences, challenges, priorities, and future needs. The survey includes questions about current implementation status, planned implementation timelines, encountered issues, feature requests, and priority areas for future development. Survey results are analyzed and published, providing a comprehensive view of the implementation landscape and informing roadmap priorities.

4. **Work Group Participation**: Participate in the HL7 Financial Management Work Group, which is responsible for the governance and maintenance of the IG. The Work Group meets regularly to review change requests, discuss implementation issues, plan future versions, and coordinate with other HL7 work groups. Participation can include attending meetings, joining task forces, contributing to discussions, reviewing proposed changes, and voting on ballot items. The Work Group welcomes participation from all stakeholders with an interest in provider credentialing and enrollment.

5. **Connectathons**: Participate in FHIR Connectathons that include provider credentialing and enrollment tracks. These events provide hands-on opportunities to test implementations, validate interoperability, identify issues, and collaborate with other implementers in a structured testing environment. Connectathon participation helps ensure that the IG meets real-world implementation needs and that implementations can successfully interoperate. Connectathon results are documented and used to inform IG improvements.

6. **Ballot Comments**: Submit ballot comments during the ballot period for each version of the IG. The ballot process allows for formal review and comment on proposed changes before they are finalized. Ballot comments are carefully reviewed by the IG maintenance team and the Financial Management Work Group, with each comment receiving a formal disposition. Commenters can participate in the reconciliation process to ensure their concerns are addressed appropriately.

Active participation from a diverse range of stakeholders ensures that the IG remains relevant, practical, and aligned with the needs of the provider credentialing and enrollment community. The IG maintenance team is committed to an open, transparent, and collaborative development process that welcomes input from all interested parties.
