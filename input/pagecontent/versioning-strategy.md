This document outlines the versioning strategy for the Medicaid Provider Credentialing and Enrollment FHIR Implementation Guide. A clear versioning approach ensures backward compatibility, smooth transitions, and effective change management.

### Versioning Principles

#### Semantic Versioning
This IG follows semantic versioning (SemVer) with the format: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that require implementation updates
- **MINOR**: New features that are backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and clarifications that are backward compatible

#### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain compatibility within major versions
- Provide migration guidance for breaking changes
- Support overlapping versions during transitions
- Minimize disruption to existing implementations

#### Change Management
- Structured change request process
- Impact assessment for all changes
- Stakeholder review and approval
- Coordinated release planning

### Version Types

#### Major Versions (X.0.0)

##### Breaking Changes Include:
- Removal of required elements
- Changes to data types
- Modification of cardinality constraints
- Removal of profiles or extensions
- Changes to value set bindings (required â†’ extensible)

##### Examples:
- Removing a required field from a profile
- Changing a string field to a coded field
- Removing support for a deprecated profile

##### Release Process:
- 6-month advance notice
- Migration guide publication
- Pilot testing period
- Coordinated implementation timeline

#### Minor Versions (X.Y.0)

##### Additive Changes Include:
- New optional elements
- New profiles or extensions
- Additional value sets
- Enhanced documentation
- New examples

##### Examples:
- Adding optional extensions to existing profiles
- Creating new profiles for additional use cases
- Adding new code systems or value sets

##### Release Process:
- 3-month advance notice
- Implementation guidance updates
- Testing and validation
- Coordinated release

#### Patch Versions (X.Y.Z)

##### Non-Breaking Changes Include:
- Bug fixes and corrections
- Documentation clarifications
- Example updates
- Typo corrections
- Technical corrections

##### Examples:
- Fixing incorrect cardinality in documentation
- Correcting example instances
- Clarifying implementation guidance

##### Release Process:
- 1-month advance notice
- Immediate availability
- Notification to implementers
- Updated documentation
