This document outlines the versioning strategy for the Medicaid Provider Credentialing and Enrollment FHIR Implementation Guide. A clear versioning approach ensures backward compatibility, smooth transitions, and effective change management.

### Versioning Principles

#### Semantic Versioning
This IG follows semantic versioning (SemVer) with the format: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

- **MAJOR: Breaking changes that require implementation updates.** These are significant changes that alter the API, data models, or functionality in ways that are not backward compatible. Implementations will need to be updated to accommodate these changes.
- **MINOR: New features that are backward compatible.** These additions enhance functionality without disrupting existing implementations. They may include new optional elements, extensions, or capabilities that don't require changes to existing code.
- **PATCH: Bug fixes and clarifications that are backward compatible.** These updates address issues, improve documentation, or make minor corrections without changing the API or data models. They ensure the implementation guide functions as intended without requiring code changes.

#### Backward Compatibility
- **Maintain compatibility within major versions:** All minor and patch releases within a major version will be backward compatible with previous releases in that major version. This ensures that implementations can update without breaking changes.
- **Provide migration guidance for breaking changes:** When a new major version introduces breaking changes, comprehensive migration guides will be published to assist implementers in transitioning their systems smoothly.
- **Support overlapping versions during transitions:** During major version transitions, both the previous and new versions will be supported simultaneously for a defined period, allowing implementers to migrate at their own pace.
- **Minimize disruption to existing implementations:** Breaking changes are carefully considered and only introduced when necessary. Whenever possible, changes are implemented in ways that minimize impact on existing systems.

#### Change Management
- **Structured change request process:** All changes to the implementation guide follow a formal request process that includes documentation of the proposed change, justification, and expected impact on implementations.
- **Impact assessment for all changes:** Each proposed change undergoes a thorough impact analysis to evaluate potential effects on existing implementations, performance, security, and compliance.
- **Stakeholder review and approval:** Changes are reviewed by key stakeholders including implementers, regulatory bodies, and subject matter experts to ensure they meet community needs and standards.
- **Coordinated release planning:** Version releases are planned and scheduled to minimize disruption, with clear communication to all stakeholders about timelines and implementation requirements.

### Version Types

#### Major Versions (X.0.0)

##### Breaking Changes Include:
- **Removal of required elements:** Eliminating elements that were previously required in profiles or resources, which would cause validation failures for implementations that don't adapt.
- **Changes to data types:** Altering the fundamental data type of an element (e.g., from string to code, or from CodeableConcept to Coding), requiring implementation changes.
- **Modification of cardinality constraints:** Changing minimum or maximum cardinality in ways that could invalidate existing data (e.g., changing optional to required, or allowing multiple values where only one was previously permitted).
- **Removal of profiles or extensions:** Deprecating and removing profiles or extensions that were previously supported, requiring implementations to transition to alternative approaches.
- **Changes to value set bindings:** Modifying binding strengths in ways that restrict previously valid data (e.g., changing from extensible to required binding), forcing implementations to conform to stricter terminology requirements.

##### Examples:
- **Removing a required field from a profile:** Eliminating the requirement for a practitioner's specialty code that was previously mandatory, requiring implementations to update their data validation and processing logic.
- **Changing a string field to a coded field:** Converting a free-text address field to a structured address format with coded elements, requiring implementations to restructure how they capture and process address information.
- **Removing support for a deprecated profile:** Discontinuing support for an older provider enrollment profile in favor of a new approach, requiring implementations to migrate to the new profile structure.

##### Release Process:
- **6-month advance notice:** Formal announcement of upcoming major version changes at least six months before release, giving implementers sufficient time to plan and prepare.
- **Migration guide publication:** Comprehensive documentation detailing all breaking changes, migration steps, and code examples to assist implementers in transitioning to the new version.
- **Pilot testing period:** A structured beta testing phase where selected implementers validate the changes in real-world scenarios and provide feedback before general release.
- **Coordinated implementation timeline:** A phased rollout schedule with clear milestones and deadlines, allowing for synchronized adoption across the implementation community.

#### Minor Versions (X.Y.0)

##### Additive Changes Include:
- **New optional elements:** Adding new optional fields or components to existing profiles that enhance functionality without requiring changes to existing implementations.
- **New profiles or extensions:** Introducing additional profiles or extensions that address new use cases or requirements while maintaining compatibility with existing implementations.
