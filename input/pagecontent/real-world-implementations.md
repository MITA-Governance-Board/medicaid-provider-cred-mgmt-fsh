### Conclusion

Implementing a FHIR-based provider credentialing and enrollment system can be challenging for resource-constrained organizations, but with a phased approach, leveraging open-source resources, and strategic outsourcing, it is achievable. The real-world examples from states that have successfully implemented such systems provide valuable insights and lessons learned that can guide your implementation journey.

By starting with a minimum viable product and gradually adding capabilities, organizations can realize benefits early while managing resource constraints. The modular implementation approach allows for flexibility in prioritizing components based on organizational needs and available resources.
