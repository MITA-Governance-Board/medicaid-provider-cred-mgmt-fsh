# Implementation Guidance

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive guidance for implementing the Medicaid Provider Credentialing and Enrollment Implementation Guide. It covers state customization frameworks, data quality considerations, security requirements, and practical implementation strategies.

## State Customization Framework {#state-customization}

### Customization Principles

States have significant flexibility in implementing Medicaid provider credentialing systems while maintaining compliance with federal requirements. This framework provides guidance on how to customize the IG to meet state-specific needs.

#### Core vs. Optional Elements
- **Core Elements**: Required by federal regulations and cannot be modified
- **Optional Elements**: May be customized or extended based on state requirements
- **State-Specific Elements**: Additional requirements unique to individual states

#### Extension Strategy
States can extend the base profiles through:
- **Additional Data Elements**: State-specific fields and requirements
- **Enhanced Validation Rules**: Stricter validation beyond federal minimums
- **Custom Value Sets**: State-specific code systems and terminologies
- **Workflow Modifications**: Customized business processes and approval workflows

### State Configuration Options

#### Provider Types and Specialties
```yaml
# Example state configuration for provider types
state_config:
  provider_types:
    - code: "MD"
      display: "Medical Doctor"
      required_credentials: ["medical_license", "board_certification"]
    - code: "NP"
      display: "Nurse Practitioner"
      required_credentials: ["nursing_license", "np_certification"]
    - code: "LCSW"
      display: "Licensed Clinical Social Worker"
      required_credentials: ["social_work_license"]
```

#### Credentialing Requirements
States can customize credentialing requirements by:
- **Education Verification**: Specific educational requirements
- **Experience Requirements**: Minimum practice experience
- **Background Checks**: Additional screening requirements
- **Continuing Education**: Ongoing education requirements

#### Approval Workflows
- **Single-Stage Approval**: Direct approval by state agency
- **Multi-Stage Approval**: Multiple review levels and approvals
- **Delegated Credentialing**: Approval by contracted organizations
- **Expedited Processing**: Fast-track for certain provider types

### Implementation Patterns

#### Profile Inheritance
```fsh
// Example of state-specific profile extension
Profile: CaliforniaMedicaidPractitioner
Parent: MedicaidPractitioner
Description: "California-specific requirements for Medicaid practitioners"
* extension contains CaliforniaLicenseExtension named californiaLicense 0..1
* qualification ^slicing.discriminator.type = #pattern
* qualification ^slicing.discriminator.path = "code"
* qualification ^slicing.rules = #open
* qualification contains CaliforniaBoardCertification 0..*
```

#### Value Set Extensions
```fsh
// Example of state-specific value set
ValueSet: CaliforniaProviderSpecialties
Id: california-provider-specialties
Title: "California Provider Specialties"
Description: "Provider specialties recognized in California Medicaid"
* include codes from valueset MedicaidProviderSpecialties
* include codes from system CaliforniaSpecialtyCodeSystem
```
