# State Customization Framework

## Overview

This framework provides guidance for states to customize the Medicaid Provider Credentialing and Enrollment Implementation Guide to meet their specific requirements while maintaining interoperability and compliance with federal regulations.

## Customization Principles

### 1. Federal Compliance First
- All customizations must comply with federal regulations
- Core CMS requirements cannot be modified
- Additional requirements may be added as needed
- State-specific regulations must be accommodated

### 2. Interoperability Preservation
- FHIR R4 base specifications must be maintained
- US Core profiles should be extended, not replaced
- Standard terminologies should be used where possible
- Custom extensions should follow FHIR guidelines

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Changes should not break existing implementations
- Version management strategies must be employed
- Migration paths must be provided
- Deprecation policies should be established

## Customization Areas

### Profile Extensions

#### State-Specific Extensions
States may create extensions for:
- Additional provider identifiers
- State-specific licensing requirements
- Local credentialing criteria
- Regional network requirements

#### Example: State Medical License Extension
```fsh
Extension: StateMedicalLicense
Id: state-medical-license
Title: "State Medical License"
Description: "State-specific medical license information"
* ^context.type = #element
* ^context.expression = "Practitioner.qualification"
* extension contains
    licenseNumber 1..1 and
    issuingState 1..1 and
    licenseType 0..1 and
    restrictions 0..*
```

### Value Set Customization

#### State-Specific Code Systems
States may define:
- Local provider types
- State-specific specialties
- Regional service categories
- Custom status codes

#### Example: State Provider Types
```fsh
CodeSystem: StateProviderTypes
Id: state-provider-types
Title: "State Provider Types"
Description: "State-specific provider type codes"
* ^caseSensitive = true
* #rural-health-clinic "Rural Health Clinic"
* #federally-qualified-health-center "Federally Qualified Health Center"
* #critical-access-hospital "Critical Access Hospital"
```

### Workflow Customizations

#### State-Specific Processes
- Additional verification steps
- Enhanced screening requirements
- Custom approval workflows
- State-specific documentation

#### Credentialing Workflow Example
1. **Initial Application**
   - Standard FHIR Practitioner resource
   - State-specific extensions for additional data
   - Custom verification requirements

2. **Enhanced Screening**
   - Additional background checks
   - State-specific database queries
   - Local reference verification

3. **Approval Process**
   - State medical board verification
   - Local credentialing committee review
   - Custom approval criteria

### Data Element Customizations

#### Required vs. Optional Elements
States may:
- Make optional elements required
- Add new required elements
- Define state-specific constraints
- Implement additional validation rules

#### Example: Enhanced Address Requirements
```fsh
Profile: StateEnhancedPractitioner
Parent: MedicaidPractitioner
Id: state-enhanced-practitioner
* address 1..*
* address.line 1..*
* address.city 1..1
* address.state 1..1
* address.postalCode 1..1
* address.country 1..1
```

## Implementation Strategies

### Layered Approach

#### Layer 1: Federal Base
- Core FHIR R4 specifications
- US Core profiles
- Federal regulatory requirements
- CMS mandated elements

#### Layer 2: State Additions
- State-specific extensions
- Additional value sets
- Enhanced constraints
- Local requirements

#### Layer 3: Local Customizations
- Regional variations
- Local policy implementations
- Organizational preferences
- Pilot program features

### Configuration Management

#### Environment-Specific Configurations
- Development environment settings
- Testing environment parameters
- Production environment constraints
- Disaster recovery configurations

#### Feature Flags
- Enable/disable state-specific features
- Gradual rollout capabilities
- A/B testing support
- Emergency rollback options

## Technical Implementation

### Extension Development

#### Best Practices
- Use descriptive extension names
- Provide comprehensive documentation
- Include usage examples
- Implement proper validation

#### Extension Registry
- Maintain central registry of extensions
- Version control for extensions
- Impact analysis for changes
- Reusability assessment

### Profile Derivation

#### Inheritance Hierarchy
```
FHIR Base Resource
  ↓
US Core Profile
  ↓
Medicaid Base Profile
  ↓
State-Specific Profile
  ↓
Local Implementation Profile
```

#### Constraint Application
- Cardinality restrictions
- Value set bindings
- Data type constraints
- Business rule validation

### API Customization

#### Endpoint Extensions
- State-specific search parameters
- Custom operation definitions
- Enhanced query capabilities
- Specialized workflows

#### Example: State Provider Search
```
GET /Practitioner?state-license=IL123456
GET /Practitioner?credentialing-status=pending
GET /Organization?network-region=chicago
```
